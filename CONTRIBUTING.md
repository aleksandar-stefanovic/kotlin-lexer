## Submitting issues
Submit an issue if:

- You find a bug (unexpected or incorrect behavior)
- You consider contributing code (see below)

**Don't** submit an issue if:

- You want to discuss something, which isn't immediately recognized as an issue, and especially if it is about the project itself (i.e. not the source code). **Use [Discussions](https://github.com/aleksandar-stefanovic/kotlin-lexer/discussions) instead**.

### What to include when submitting an issue

Generally, the most helpful thing is to submit steps to reproduce the bug. If the bug can't be reproduced, it could be very hard to troubleshoot.
Other than that, you can post the usual stuff: the platform on which the bug occured, the version of the project, etc.

## Contributing and pull requests

If you are considering contributing to the project (thank you!), the first thing you should do is to either submit an issue 
which describes what is the issue you've found with the project, or, if it is a more substantial change, create a thread in Discussions.
After the issue is discussed or confirmed, you can submit a pull request solving the issue. When contributing code, try to:
- Adhere to the [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#configure-style-in-ide)
- Match the style and the spirit of the existing project code (at this point, there are no explicit guidelines, but you'll get a feel for it if you read the source code)
- Generally, the less code there is to review, the faster and the easier the review process goes, so:
  - If the issue is too big, consider submitting multiple issues (which will result in multiple pull requests)
  - If the pull request is non-trivial, split it into multiple reasonable commits
